On 996, I would also like to share my views. Since I have chosen the path of programmer, I should know what I will face, even if it is difficult to go on. Again, the question of the working system.
In my opinion, one of the important reasons for overtime is that there is little communication between the employer and the staff. Many things are not actively discussed during the day, but silently.
At night, employees and bosses will trigger overtime when they check and accept the results of work. And we as employees, Wicker get this salary, can only silently continue to work overtime. Actually, I think so.
The reason why programmers work overtime is largely due to the inefficiency during the day. In order to get things quickly, bosses have to work overtime at night. Actually, as long as we make full use of it.
During the day time, timely communication, overtime situation is still rare. Seeing this, I guess someone will scold me and say I don't understand the programmer's pain. Indeed, that's really possible.
I'll swear, but actually what I want to say is. It's also because of the environment, because as a technology company, if you can't quickly develop new things, you always use other companies'products.
Frame. So it's hard for you to sit up, so that's why many bosses are eager to succeed, because in the IT industry, if you don't move forward, you just step back and wait until someone else overtakes you, then
You're behind. So it's this environment that leads to this. I think how to solve this problem should be solved and discussed at present, not a large group of programmers.
Collective protests on the Internet. Otherwise, it will eventually be covered by new content, and the voice of protest will be drowned out!
